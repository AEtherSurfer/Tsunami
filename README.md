## Known Issues

- Magenta can't send waves reliably. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Animations need lots of work.
- Out of lives does not disable player from sending waves.
- Resetting to Ocean should run setup maybe, and start fresh? (Refresh lives on Blink)
- Waves of the same color will cancel eachother out.
- Large wholes in the ocean (3-4+ tiles) will create continuous wave generators.
